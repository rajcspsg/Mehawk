# Telesto 🪐

Telesto is a discord overlay app named after a Saturn moon.

The original idea behind this app was to serve as an overlay for Discord, but this requires self-botting.
Since Discord is not very keen on self bots I feel like this project should be pushed a little bit forward.
It's still in the planning phase, mostly, so I think that the best way for this project to have a future is to allow multiple backends,
like matrix, irc, discord and some other, maybe.

Other than that - the original plan to use GTK is ditched, it will make way more sense for the application to use OpenGL.
